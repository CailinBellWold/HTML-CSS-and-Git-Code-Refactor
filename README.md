# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

Refactor code to increase web **accessibility** for a fictional marketing agency called Horiseon. 

### Motivation

Accessibility centers user experience and technological innovation. As human interlocutors between humanity and technology, we consider both the technological read-ability of our code and the rich meaning conveyed by seemingly simple images. Does an image *mean* "an office table with people seated around it" or "engaged and inclusive collaboration?" What description maps to the meaning derived by a sighted person who experiences the image integrated into the story being told across the platform?

In order to communicate effectively, we need to consider our audience, whose sensory and mobility experiences may include assistive technology.  The decisions we make behind the scenes fundamentally effect other humans' experience of the story being told or service being offered and so should be carefully considered.    


### Learning Targets
This exercise required researching accessibility standards (WCAG), understanding the source code, writing semantic elements, consolidating redundant CSS, incorporating alt tags and aria-labels, and gaining experience uploading and publishing on GitHub.

I learned a good amount about HTML page structure and CSS layout, commenting out CSS, and using GitHub.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards:

1. WHEN I view the source code, THEN I find semantic HTML elements

2. WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements, THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

3. WHEN I view the image elements, THEN I find accessible alt attributes

4. WHEN I view the heading attributes, THEN they fall in sequential order

5. WHEN I view the title element, THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
